        <h2 id="firsth2">Where We Come From</h2>
        <p id="firstp">The PVPG Organization started as an Alumni Advocacy Project of the Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus, bringing together young professionals and student leaders who shared a passion for city development and community service. From small initiatives such as local consultations and urban clean-up drives, the group steadily grew in scope and reputation. By its 3rd Foundation Anniversary, the members formally established PVPG as an independent region-wide organization, marking the beginning of its stronger role in shaping sustainable development efforts in Davao and beyond.
        <br> <br> On its current path, PVPG has earned recognition as a UN-accredited organization with a growing network of over 50 full-time workers, 30 part-time members, and hundreds of volunteer advocates. Backed by more than 10 sponsorships and partnerships, it has built a remarkable record in promoting eco-friendly housing, disaster-resilient planning, and green urban spaces. With its diverse membership and commitment to service, PVPG continues to stand as a strong force for inclusive growth and future-ready communities in Mindanao </p>

        <h2 id="firsth2">The Person Behind It All</h2>
        <p id="firstp">Nice to meet you! I am Arya Nurjannah B. Mitmug and my journey began as a student of the PSHS SMC, where I first discovered how science and community work can go hand in hand. Between research projects and student-led initiatives like clean-up drives and tree-planting, I learned early on the importance of using knowledge and teamwork to make a positive impact.
        <br> <br> am an advocate for Sustainable Urban Planning for the community and the environment. My advocacy has been rooted in the belief that communities can thrive when people work together to build safer, greener, and more inclusive spaces.
        <br> <br>Now, I am the Founder and CEO of the PVPG Group, and plan to continue to serve my community. What began as a simple passion project and volunteer work with fellow PSHS-SMC alumni grew into a wider effort to promote sustainable living, community participation, and care for the environment.
