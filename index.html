        <h2 id="firsth2">The Present State of Urbanization</h2>
        <p id="firstp">Over half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, expected to reach 68% by 2050. In the Philippines, cities like Manila and Davao are growing even faster. While this brings progress, it also causes environmental problems like ecosystem damage, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss.
        <br> <br>These issues threaten our natural world, daily lives, and hinder progress toward UN SDG 11, which aims for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. Globally, cities cover 3% of land but use 60-80% of energy and emit 75% of carbon emissions.
        <br> <br>The Philippines is tackling urban problems with support from partners like the World Bank. Sustainable urban planning aligned with SDG 11 is promoted, with cities like Davao adopting policies for green infrastructure, waste management, and sustainable transportation. Nationwide efforts also focus on cleaner energy, better housing, and disaster resilience. Strengthening governance and climate-ready infrastructure helps build more inclusive, sustainable cities in the country.

            <h3>Green Spaces Are Expanding</h3>
            <p>The amount of green space in cities has grown steadily, reaching 20% in 2023 compared to only 10–12% in 2015. This shows that efforts to increase vegetation and open areas are working, which can help improve air quality, provide shade, and make cities more livable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="secondarticle">
            <h3>Urban Heat Is Rising</h3>
            <p>Even with more green areas, <em>cities are still getting hotter</em>, rising from 38°C in 2015 to 40°C in 2023. This means our current efforts are not enough. We need more trees and parks, to combat the rapid urbanization, and make cities cooler and healthier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="secondarticle">
            <h3>Access to Parks Is Improving</h3>
            <p>Access to public parks and open spaces has also increased, moving from 60% in 2015 to 70% in 2023. This means more people are able to enjoy recreational spaces, which is important for health, community bonding, and overall quality of life in growing cities.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Let's not let this great progress of expanding green space and more accesible public parks go to waste, until the damage is irreversible.</p>
